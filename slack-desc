libdvbcsa: libdvbcsa (A free implementation of DVB Common Scrambling Algorithm)
libdvbcsa:
libdvbcsa: libdvbcsa is a free implementation of the DVB Common Scrambling
libdvbcsa: Algorithm with encryption and decryption capabilities.  The library
libdvbcsa: has been successfully tested on different processors with 32 bits,
libdvbcsa: 64 bits and 128 bits word width, little-endian and big-endian bytes
libdvbcsa: ordering.
libdvbcsa: The library performance comes in two flavors: a classical single
libdvbcsa: packet implementation and a faster parallel bitslice implementation.
libdvbcsa: The parallel implementation can take advantages of MMX, SSE or
libdvbcsa: Altivec instruction sets.  Parallel implementation can process Mpeg
libdvbcsa: TS packets at 300Mbps or more on recent processors.
libdvbcsa: It's released under the General Public License, ensuring it will
libdvbcsa: stay free, and used only for free software products.
